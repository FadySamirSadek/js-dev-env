# js-dev-env
This is the javascript development environment i use in all my projects
We are using editorconfig in this dev environment you can find the plugin you need for your text editor here :http://editorconfig.org/
We recommend manually running Node security platform to check any package before use
##we will be using local tunnel as our development web server for exposing our local port and enable beta testers before hosting our website
## we will be using npm scripts as our task runners
###Do not forget to use the -s flag when using npm start to stop the extra commands running in the terminal
